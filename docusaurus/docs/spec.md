## What is `Spec`?

[Spec] is a specification of behavior that we record and replay.
It is identified by the [`specName`][specName], which you defined when using the mocktomata:

```ts
mockto('<specName>', ...)

komondor('<specName>')

scenario('<specName>') // zucchini
```

## Uniqueness of `specName`

Because [`specName`][specName] is the identifier of [Spec],
the [`specName`][specName] must be unique for each test in the same file.

For example, if you use `"get friends"` as the [`specName`][specName] in two test of a test file,
one of them will fail.
This holds true even if you use some grouping mechanism such as `describe()` to put tests in different group.

However, it will be fine if the same [`specName`][specName] is used in two different test files.

So what you can do is either making sure you use a different [`specName`][specName] in the same file across `describe()` groups,
or you can separate each group into different files. For example:

```sh
- someCode.group-1.spec.ts
- someCode.group-2.spec.ts
```

This is also the way `tap` family of test runners (e.g. `ava`) organize the tests.

## What can be a `spec subject`?

[spec subject][spec-subject] is the code you want to record the behavior from.
The most common use case is a `gateway` function or library,
such as `axios` or `fetch`.

But it can be any other things, such as `gateway` to your database,
file system, another thread,
or even libraries or code from another team that might not be stable.

In essence, it can be anything that is external, suspect to chanages,
or anything unstable.

## `SpecRecord`

[SpecRecord](#specrecord) is the record of a [Spec] that we saved.
It is saved in the `.mocktomata` folder under the root of your project.
In the future, they can also be saved remotely too.

The [`done()`](#done) method returns the [SpecRecord],
so you can inspect it if you wanted to.

## `spec()`

[`spec()`](#spec) function is the function to specify the [spec subject][spec-subject].

```ts
function spec(subject, options?): Promise<subject>
```

Where the return promise contains the "speced" subject which you can use in place of `subject`.

You can specify a `mock` using the `options`:

```ts
spec(subject, { mock: mockSubject })
```

When running in `mock` mode (e.g. `mockto.mock(...)`),
the `mockSubject` will be used instead of the `subject`.
In other modes, the `mockSubject` will be ignored.

This is useful to write a test with a mock subject,
while the actual subject/remote system is not ready yet.

## `Spec.Options`

`Spec.Options` is used by the `mocktomata` to configure the spec. It contains 3 properties:

- `timeout`: How long will the spec wait before consider the subject failed to return. (default to `3000` ms)
- `logLevel`: Log level for logging the behavior (default to `logLevels.info`)
- `emitLog`: When true, emit logs to console (default `false`)

Here is how do specify the `options` for other mocktomata:

```ts
mockto(specName, options?, handler)
komondor(specName, options?)
scenario(specName, options?) // zucchini
incubator(specName, options?, handler)
```

## `reporter`

[`reporter`](#reporter) is a [MemoryLogReporter][memoryLogReporter] from [standard-log][standard-log].
It contains the logs generated by [mocktomata] so that you can inspect them.

A common use case is to inspect the logs make sure it does not contain any sensitive information.

## `SpecMode`

Each [Spec] runs in a specific mode depends on the condition.
There are 4 different [`SpecMode`](#specmode):

- `auto`: the default mode which will resolve to either `save` or `simulate` mode.
- `save`: actual calls will be made and the behavior are saved (i.e. recording).
- `simulate`: actual calls are not made and the behavior are simulated (i.e. replay).
- `live`: actual calls are made but the behavior are not saved.

## `done()`

[`done()`](#done) should be called at the end of each [Spec].
It is how the [Spec] knows it should save the [SpecRecord] or make sure the simulation are complete fully.

It is an async function returning the [SpecRecord] (`done(): Promise<SpecRecord>`).

You can inspec the [SpecRecord] if you want to,
but typically you will just `await` or return it:

```ts

it('...', async () => {
  // ...

  await done()

  // or return, if your test-runner support that.
  return done()
}
```

## `cleanup()`

[`cleanup()`](#cleanup) function is used to clean up the test environment.

You should call it at `afterAll()` or similar function:

```ts
afterall(mockto.cleanup)
afterall(komondor.cleanup)
afterall(scenario.cleanup) // zucchini
afterall(incubator.cleanup)
```

What happens is when the [`done()`](#done) is not called,
either you forget to do so or the test fails,
the [Spec] does not know that and keep waiting for the [`done()`](#done) call.

In that case you will see a warning like this (in `jest`):

```sh
A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited.
This is likely caused by tests leaking due to improper teardown.
Try running with --detectOpenHandles to find leaks.
Active timers can also cause this, ensure that `.unref()` was called on them.
```

calling [`cleanup()`](#cleanup) tells [mocktomata] that all [Spec] are done so it can clean things up properly.

## `maskValue()`

When interacting with external system,
the calls may contain sensitive information such as username, password, auth token, etc.

Since [mocktomata] will save the [SpecRecord],
it is important to make sure these sensitive information will not be saved in your repository.
The same goes for logs, as you may send the logs else where or save it in some files.

[`maskValue()`](#maskvalue) allows you to indicate what values are considered sensitive,
and mask them in the logs and in [SpecRecord].

It support `string` and `RegExp`, and its signature is:

```ts
function maskValue(value: string | RegExp, replaceWith?: string)
```

The `RegExp` will be `.exec()` against the values,
so if the sensitive information can occurs multiple times in the same string,
use the `/g` global flag to make sure all occurrences are masked:

Note that the value is checked against each log message and each metadata within the record.
So you should avoid using start and end anchor (`^` and `$`) as there will be extra text around subject.

```ts
maskValue(/some-secret/g)
maskValue(/Bearer \.*/g)
```

The `replaceWith` defaults to `"[masked]"`.
You can change that if you want,
and you can change it different values for each [`maskValue()`](#maskvalue) call if you find that beneficial.

You must call [`maskValue()`](#maskvalue) before calling [`spec()`](#spec),
because calling [`spec()`](#spec) will starting emitting/saving logs.

Depends on how the sensitive information is created, who created it,
and what [SpecMode](#specmode) the [Spec] is running in,
the value flow through your code could be the actual sensitive value,
or the masked value.

so in your test, you should avoid checking the value explicitly.
Your code will probably work as-is.
If you absolutely need to,
you can use the `replaceWith` to set the masked value to something your code understand,
and yet the value is safe to be saved in your source control.

## `ignoreMismatch()`

Sometimes the input you provide to the test may not be static.
For example, random number, date time, or hostnames.

In 7.0, reference values (string, object, array, function) are not validate for changes,
i.e. even if you pass in a different string, the system will not fail it with `ActionMismatch` error.
This is because we track the behavior, not and exact call, whenever possible.

This is a new concept and is subject to change if it does not work well.

On the other hand, primitive values such as number and boolean are validated.

If you want to tell [`spec()`](#spec) that it should not care about the changes,
you can use [`ignoreMismatch()`](#ignoremismatch) to ignore that specific value.

The value is compared using strict equivalence. (i.e. `===`).
For example:

```ts
test('...', async () => {
  const date = new Date()

  const spec = komondor('...')
  spec.ignoreMismatch(date)

  // ...
})
